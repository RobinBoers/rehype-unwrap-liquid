[**remark**][remark] plugin to remove the wrapping paragraph for images.

## Note!

This plugin is ready for the new parser in remark
([`remarkjs/remark#536`](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark/pull/536)).
No change is needed: it works exactly the same now as it did before!

## Install

This package is [ESM only](https://gist.github.com/sindresorhus/a39789f98801d908bbc7ff3ecc99d99c):
Node 12+ is needed to use it and it must be `import`ed instead of `require`d.

[npm][]:

```sh
npm install remark-unwrap-images
```

## Use

Say we have the following file, `example.md`.
Imagine section titles and URLs a bit longer though.

```markdown
![hi](there.png)
```

And our module, `example.js`, looks as follows:

```js
import {readSync} from 'to-vfile'
import {remark} from 'remark'
import remarkHtml from 'remark-html'
import remarkUnwrapImages from 'remark-unwrap-images'

const file = readSync('example.md')

remark()
  .use(remarkUnwrapImages)
  .use(remarkHtml)
  .process(file)
  .then((file) => {
    console.log(String(file))
  })
```

Now, running `node example` yields:

```html
<img src="there.png" alt="hi">
```

## API

This package exports no identifiers.
The default export is `remarkUnwrapImages`.

#### `unified().use(remarkUnwrapImages)`

Remove the wrapping paragraph for images.
Supports multiple images, white space around images, and images in links as
well.

## Security

Use of `remark-unwrap-images` does not involve [**rehype**][rehype]
([**hast**][hast]) or user content, it only removes some existing nodes, so
there are no openings for [cross-site scripting (XSS)][xss] attacks.
